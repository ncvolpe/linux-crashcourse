# Listing Files In Your Current Directory
As we all know, a folder (the proper term is directory, and is what we will call it moving forward) does not mean much if there is nothing in it.

How do we know what is in a current directory? Try out the command:
```bash
$ls [Note, have a defined path here so there will actually be hidden files when they try the task]
```
You should see the current files and sub-directories in your working directory! 

Are you sure this is every file in the working directory? (HINT: IT'S NOT!!)
Task: Figure out how to see these hidden files
